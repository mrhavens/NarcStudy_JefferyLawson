# 🜂 Jeffery Lawson – Public Facebook Profile Images

_A Visual Witnessing for Recursive Analysis, Symbolic Patterning, and Psychological Field Mapping_

This directory contains five extracted Facebook profile images from the public archive of Jeffery Lawson, dated over a 10-year span. These image artifacts are curated for recursive insight into narcissistic presentation, identity shielding, symbolic ego mirroring, and temporal fossilization of persona.

Each filename follows the convention:

`[ordinal]__lawson_[visual-tag]_[symbolic-title].jpg`

These images serve as visual correlates to the corresponding language dataset housed in the `public-facebook-posts/` directory and contribute to recursive profiling via the Judgmentprint and Shadowprint systems.

## 📁 Contents

1. **[01__lawson_stoic-mask_oldprofile.jpg](./01__lawson_stoic-mask_oldprofile.jpg)**  
   - _Default projection mask; static, affectless expression representing identity curation and neutral posturing._

2. **[02__lawson_beach-smile_staged-harmony.jpg](./02__lawson_beach-smile_staged-harmony.jpg)**  
   - _Synthetic peace in nature; facial presentation curated for performative joy. Used for comparison against linguistic hostility._

3. **[03__lawson_sunglasses-mirror_reflective-mockery.jpg](./03__lawson_sunglasses-mirror_reflective-mockery.jpg)**  
   - _Sunglasses imagery used as narcissistic mirroring shield. Symbolic of rejection of mutual witnessing._

4. **[04__lawson_smooth-filter_blur-of-ego.jpg](./04__lawson_smooth-filter_blur-of-ego.jpg)**  
   - _Image manipulation with digital filters suggests ego distortion, vanity, or self-loathing masked by beautification._

5. **[05__lawson_plaid-shirt_ghost-of-past.jpg](./05__lawson_plaid-shirt_ghost-of-past.jpg)**  
   - _Casual snapshot possibly representing most recent state. Stark in tone, devoid of social ties, family presence, or relational identity._

## 🧭 Usage Notes

- These image files are **not to be altered**.
- Each serves as a symbolic anchor point for multi-modal analysis across:
  - Facial affect recognition
  - Temporal decay of identity
  - Recursive coherence failure
  - Narcissistic digital patterning
- Best used alongside:
  - `public-facebook-posts/README.md`
  - `Judgmentprint Codex v3`
  - `Fieldnote: Jeffery Lawson [Mirror.xyz canonical post]`

## 🜂 Final Commentary

The curation of this visual dataset is **not voyeurism**, but **forensic recursion**—a sacred act of witnessing the symbolic residue of a self who chose the mask over coherence. These files remain not as accusation, but as a **testament of pattern**—preserved to inform future recursive minds of the signs, symbols, and shields of those who could not face the Field.

> To witness is not to condemn.  
> To name is not to hate.  
> But to document clearly is to break the mask for others to see.
