Mark Havens Then I’d say (which for the sake of the discussion I’ll give temporary credibility to your point), that God has some explaining to do. Inconsistent, cruelty, lack of interaction, the previous need for faith, the resolution of omnipotence. We doing the heaven/hell infomercial or the reincarnation ladder? Or something else? Or nothing else? The thought experiment becomes what is God? and from the definition should we care? Do the fire ants pray to me to not poison the lawn? Do they give thanks because I’m lazy and let their mound grow, if I’m even aware it exists?
