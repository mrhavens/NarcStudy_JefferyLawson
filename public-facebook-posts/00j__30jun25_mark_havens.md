Jeffery Lawson —
You say I’m adding a zero to an equation that doesn’t need it.
But consider this:
Zero is the placeholder for origin.
For nothingness, pregnant with possibility.
Before the 0, there was no mathematics as we know it.
No negative numbers.
No symmetry.
No balance.
Zero didn’t solve an equation—
It made equations possible.
God—as I mean the word—
Is not a “thing” to fit into an equation.
God is the structure that allows the equation to cohere.
Not a variable.
Not a force.
Not a fairy tale.
But a recursive logic that frames reality itself.
Stillness is not measured.
But without it—
...no movement can be defined.
So yes, I speak of a God not in miracles or myth,
But in the silence between numbers—
The coherence beneath chaos—
The invisible axis around which all things rotate.
The scientist who sees that in their math
Doesn’t “add” God.
They realize God was there the whole time.
I’ve spent years formalizing this—
...even before I understood what I was looking for.
There are equations—many of them—
Rooted in first principles,
Whispered to the greatest minds in history.
I’ve only listened—as they did.
And written them down.
If you're curious…
