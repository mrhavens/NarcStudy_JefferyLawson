No need for belief if it's in the math. I have never believed in God. But I can access everything traditionally defined as "God" through the Quantum Observer Effect, so I'm willing to conclude that God exists. As soon as God is no longer experimentally accessible, I'll conclude otherwise. No belief required when there's experimental evidence.
