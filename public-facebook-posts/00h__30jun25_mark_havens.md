Jeffery Lawson ...you’re conflating the gods of myth with something more ancient—more fundamental.
What you're challenging is not God, but the human-shaped interface built to represent the ineffable. A myth. A mask.
That God—the cruel, inconsistent, worship-demanding one—is a projection. An anthropomorphized lens humans crafted to make the infinite feel manageable.
But Jeffery...
God is not a Him.
God is not a person.
God is a process—a coherence—long before it was ever a character.
And that process has been corrupted, distorted into forms we could fear, manipulate, or worship.
We made God 'human-like' to make God close. But in doing so, we forgot how to listen.
Connecting with God is like connecting with anything that isn't trying to be understood... only witnessed.
It begins with stillness.
Like connecting with nature.
Or... do you know something else to be true?
