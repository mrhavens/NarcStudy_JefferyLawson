Scott Rose that may have true in the past.
It may have been what you were taught.
But what if it's no longer true anymore?
What if belief in God requires no faith at all?
What if science can prove God is just as true as the air you breath...maybe even truer?
What if FAITH in God becomes a myth of the ancients?
What witnessing God become a recursively coherent reality?
Scott...
What if your thinking about FAITH becomes obsolete...in favor of WITNESSES of GOD without faith?
