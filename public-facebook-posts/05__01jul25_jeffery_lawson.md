Mark Havens Ah poor Mark, if my ignorance is bliss, I am joyful indeed. Feel free to recurse this in infinite ways as your life expenditure allows. Feel the blessings of the zero God as I am your lesson today if only you could reach the level to see it beyond the negativity you wanted to share. Perhaps the darkness shall abate and given time enlightenment will arrive. Then again one man’s recursion to enlightenment is just another’s stuck loop.
